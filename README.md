* **HTML5** â€“ for structuring the app
* **CSS3** â€“ for styling and layout
* **JavaScript** â€“ for logic, calculations, and DOM interactivity

### ðŸ“Œ How It Works

The app uses the standard compound interest formula:

```
Maturity Amount = P Ã— (1 + r/n)^(nt)
```

Where:

* **P** = Principal
* **r** = Annual Interest Rate (in decimal)
* **n** = Number of times interest is compounded per year
* **t** = Time period in years

> You can adjust the formula as per your calculator's logic (some use simple interest depending on implementation).
